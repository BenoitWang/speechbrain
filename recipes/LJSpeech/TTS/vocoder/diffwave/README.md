# DiffWave
This folder contrains scripts for running a vocoder using [Diffwave](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09761.pdf)

DiffWave is a versatile diffusion model for audio synthesis, which  produces high-fidelity audio in different waveform generation tasks, including neural vocoding conditioned on mel spectrogram, class-conditional generation, and unconditional generation.

Here it serves as a vocoder that converts a spectrogram into a waveform.

# Training
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml`

The scripts will output the results to <output_folder>/samples, for every training epoch

We suggest using tensorboard_logger by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus Tensorboard should be installed.

Training takes about X hours on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](to add)

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](to add).

# Fast Sampling
For inference, a fast sampling can be realized by passing user-defined variance schedules. According to the paper, high-quality audios can be generated with only 6 steps.
